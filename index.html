Some of the more highly-paid and in-demand positions are discussed below to give you a sense of their requirements and salary expectations.<br><br><br>
                
                1. Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and Indian Foreign Services (IFS) Jobs : The role of an IAS officer may include advising the ministers on various policy issues, implementing policies of the government, collecting revenue, and supervising public spending.
